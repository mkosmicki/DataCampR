#Functions
# Basic Function template
myfunction <- function (arg1, arg2) {
Body
}

# Define ratio() function
ratio <- function(x, y) {
  x/y
}

# Call ratio() with arguments 3 and 4
ratio(x=3, y=4)
# OR
ratio(3,4)

# Rewrite the call to follow best practices
mean(0.1, x = c(1:9, NA),TRUE)
# Solution
mean(c(1:9, NA), trim = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)

#Scoping describes how R looks up values by name
#When you call a function, a new environment is made for the function to do its work
#The new environment is populated with the argument values
#Objects are looked for first in this environment
#Describes where, not when, to look for a value
#Each call to a function has its own clean environment

#Every vector has two key properties
#Type typeof()
#Length length()
